# Movie App
A movie app made with Angular, TypeScript, Rxjs and Redux.


### Technology
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [~~Rxjs~~](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) - _not yet integrated!_
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)


### Features
- **Movies List**
  - List Movies.
  - ~~Search.~~
  - Clicking on a particular movie will redirect you to the selected &#39;movie detail&#39; page.
- **Movie detail**
  - Show selected movie detail information.
  - Navigate back to &#39;movie list&#39;.
- **Genres List**
  - List Genres.

Pages should have proper urls and navigation should work as expected:
  - using the back and forward button of the browser should take to the correct page
  - ~~reloading the current page should work as expected~~


### To Do
- Integrate Rxjs (where applicable)
- Activate Search functionality
- Load the app through a server
- Enable universal rendering


### Getting Started
Start by cloning the repo to your machine then run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. Once complete, you can run any of the commands below.


### Commands
| Command | Description
